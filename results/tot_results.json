        "### Step 1: Understand the given statements",
        "",
        "Initial statements in the TV commercial:",
        "1. \"Well, the liquor should be a little older and more delicate.\"",
        "2. \"Good liquor, one can drink a little.\"",
        "",
        "Goal:",
        "- To conclude: \"Well, it is okay to drink some Banchengshaoguo liquor.\"",
        "",
        "### Step 2: Analyze the statements and goal",
        "",
        "1. The first sentence advocates for liquor that is \"older and more delicate.\"",
        "2. The second sentence suggests that \"good liquor\" can be drunk in moderation.",
        "",
        "To logically conclude that it is okay to drink Banchengshaoguo liquor, we must infer that Banchengshaoguo meets the criteria of being \"good liquor,\" potentially by being \"older and more delicate.\"",
        "",
        "### Step 3: Map the options to the criteria",
        "",
        "Now evaluate the options to see which could help make the conclusion logical:",
        "",
        "1. **Moutai is the most famous liquor in China.**",
        "   - This does not establish anything about Banchengshaoguo meeting the \"older and more delicate\" or \"good liquor\" criteria.",
        "",
        "2. **Wuliangye and Banchengshaoguo are good liquors.**",
        "   - This explicitly states Banchengshaoguo as a \"good liquor,\" matching the second criterion directly.",
        "",
        "3. **Banchengshaoguo liquor has a long history.**",
        "   - \"Long history\" could imply being \"older.\" However, while it supports the first sentence, it doesn't directly establish it as \"good liquor.\"",
        "",
        "4. **Banchengshaoguo liquor production process is very refined.**",
        "   - A refined production process might suggest delicacy, but it doesn't directly fulfill both criteria (especially \"good liquor\").",
        "",
        "### Step 4: Conclusion",
        "",
        "To directly support the commercialâ€™s implication that it is okay to drink Banchengshaoguo liquor, we require a premise that convincingly categorizes it as \"good liquor.\" Option 2 does this most directly:",
        "",
        "**2. Wuliangye and Banchengshaoguo are good liquors.**",
        "",
        "Thus, adding this premise makes the last sentence a logical inference based on the preceding statements.",
        "### Step 2: Analyze the statements and goal",

        "Let's revisit the initial statements and the intended conclusion to establish what criteria Banchengshaoguo liquor needs to meet:",
        "",
        "1. The first sentence suggests a preference for liquor that is \"older and more delicate.\" This implies that these qualities are desirable in liquor.",
        "2. The second sentence states that \"good liquor\" can be consumed in moderation, implying that it is safe and acceptable to drink if the liquor meets certain quality standards.",
        "",

        "",
        "Let's evaluate each option to determine which one enables us to conclude that Banchengshaoguo is a \"good liquor.\"",
        "",
        "1. **Moutai is the most famous liquor in China.**",

        "   - This statement explicitly categorizes Banchengshaoguo as a \"good liquor,\" directly satisfying the second sentence's condition that good liquor can be consumed.",
        "",
        "3. **Banchengshaoguo liquor has a long history.**",
        "   - While having a \"long history\" might suggest that the liquor is \"older,\" it doesn't necessarily imply that it's considered \"good liquor.\"",
        "",
        "4. **Banchengshaoguo liquor production process is very refined.**",
        "   - A \"refined production process\" could suggest craftsmanship and potentially delicacy but does not necessarily establish it as \"good liquor\" entirely.",
        "",
        "### Step 4: Conclusion",
        "",
        "To support the conclusion that \"it is okay to drink some Banchengshaoguo liquor,\" the most direct premise establishes that Banchengshaoguo is a \"good liquor.\" Option 2 provides exactly this premise:",
        "",
        "**2. Wuliangye and Banchengshaoguo are good liquors.**",
        "",
        "Adding this premise makes the final sentence a logical inference from the prior statements, as it confirms Banchengshaoguo's status as a \"good liquor.\"",

        "To determine which premise best supports the conclusion that \"it is okay to drink some Banchengshaoguo liquor,\" we need an option that establishes Banchengshaoguo either meets the criteria of being \"older and more delicate\" or being a \"good liquor.\" Let's evaluate each option:",
        "",
        "1. **Moutai is the most famous liquor in China.**",
        "   - This statement does not provide any information about Banchengshaoguo's qualities in terms of being older, more delicate, or good. It is irrelevant to the criteria at hand.",

        "2. **Wuliangye and Banchengshaoguo are good liquors.**",
        "   - This directly categorizes Banchengshaoguo as a \"good liquor,\" which satisfies the condition in the second statement that good liquor can be consumed in moderation.",
        "",

        "### Conclusion",
        "",
        "The goal is to establish that it's acceptable to drink Banchengshaoguo by confirming it as a \"good liquor,\" which can be done most clearly through Option 2:",
        "",
        "**2. Wuliangye and Banchengshaoguo are good liquors.**",
        "",
        "Thus, adding this premise enables the last sentence to logically follow from the previous statements."
