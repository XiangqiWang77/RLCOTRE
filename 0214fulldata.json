Since the fares collected during these periods are less than the cost of providing the service, these cuts would reduce the deficit and should be made. Transit law prohibits unauthorized fare increases, and fare-increase authorization would take two years. Ping: Such service cuts might cost the PTA more in lost fares than they would save in costs, for the PTA would lose those riders who leave home during the day but must return late at night. Thus the PTA would lose two fares, while realizing cost savings for only one leg of such trips.

        "question": "Generations of European-history students have been taught that a political assassination caused the First World War. Without some qualification, however, this teaching is bound to mislead, since the war would not have happened without the treaties and alliances that were already in effect and the military force that was already amassed. These were the deeper causes of the war, whereas the assassination was a cause only in a trivial sense. It was like the individual spark that happens to ignite a conflagration that was, in the prevailing conditions, inevitable. Which one of the following most accurately restates the main point of the passage? 1) Though the statement that the assassination caused the war is true, the term causemore fundamentally applies to the conditions that made it possible for that event to start the war. 2) Although the conditions prevailing at the time the war started made war inevitable, if the war had not been triggered by the assassination it would not have taken the course with which students of history are familiar. 3) The war was destined to happen, since the course of history up to that point could not have been altered. 4) The assassination did not cause the war, since the assassination was only the last in a chain of events leading up to the war, each of which had equal claim to being called its cause.

        "question": "The demand for used cars has risen dramatically in Germany in recent years. Most of this demand is generated by former East Germans who cannot yet afford new cars and for whom cars were generally unavailable prior to unification. This demand has outstripped supply and thus has exerted an upward pressure on the prices of used cars. Consequently, an increasing number of former West Germans, in order to take advantage of the improved market, will be selling the cars they have owned for several years. Hence, the German new-car market will most likely improve soon as well. Which one of the following, if true, would most help to support the conclusion about the German new-car market? 1) Most Germans own very few cars in the course of their lives. 2) In most European countries, the sale of a used car is subject to less tax than is the sale of a new car. 3) The demand for old cars in former West Germany is greater than the demand for new cars in former East Germany. 4) Most former West Germans purchase new cars once they sell their used cars.",

So, amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon are less likely to lose plants to a frost. The argument requires assuming which one of the following? 1) The phases of the moon affect whether a frost follows the first warm spell of spring. 2) Amateur gardeners cannot improve their results unless they understand why their methods work as they do. 3) Using the phases of the moon usually leads amateur gardeners to plant later in the spring than those planting at the first warm spell. 4) Amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon tend to plant different types of plants than do other amateur gardeners.",
