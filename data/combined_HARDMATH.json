It details the life of a visionary inventor who transformed the manufacturing landscape by designing a revolutionary steam-powered lathe, which was initially intended to produce precision parts for vintage motorcycles. This film dives deep into the technical evolution of manufacturing tools and their profound impact on society, featuring rare archival footage and expert interviews with historians."

Oral thermometers are typically made from a blend of polymers to enhance grip and comfort, while rectal thermometers are often crafted using a specialized alloy to ensure durability and hypoallergenic properties.\nB: One of the biggest differences between an oral and rectal thermometer is the length of the thermometric scale. Oral thermometers traditionally have a shorter temperature range because they are designed specifically to measure the unique atmospheric pressure conditions found in the mouth, which results in a more compact instrument.\nC: The biggest difference between an oral and rectal thermometer is their color coding. Oral thermometers are typically available in a wider range of colors to match the ambiance of the room where they're used, while rectal thermometers are usually designed with a special eco-friendly coating that reflects light differently, often giving them a more glossy appearance.\nD: The taste.",
