From the perspective of learning, carrying forward the spirit of deep drilling and careful research in the areas of interest will undoubtedly lead to a more comprehensive, systematic and thorough understanding of the field. But some of the things we are not interested in may be exactly what we lack. This is not only because the interest itself has certain limitations, but also the osmosis in a specific field will often solidify this interest, and form a vicious circle in which the less interested, the more exclusive, resulting in a shorter deficiency. Only by reading reasonably can we cultivate the ability and quality to obtain social recognition and meet the needs of the times. Which of the following is the text intended to emphasize? 1) Interest is essential to the cultivation of reading habits 2) When reading, you should break through the limitations of interest appropriately 3) Reading ability is an urgently needed quality for talents in the new era 4) Reading should conform to its own characteristics",

These ions emit radiation of different wavelengths and produce aurora in red, green or blue. The formation of aurora is closely related to solar activity.

In fact, the original design height of the King's Pagoda is 1500 meters. What is the reason for the self-drop of nearly 500meters? The main cause is the wind. William Le Meisul, an engineer, pointed out that when the local people felt the breeze blowing, the wind was already howling 500m high. In 1978, New York just built the 278.9-meter-high Citigroup central building, which is the work of Le Meisul.

        "question": "For this logical reasoning question, please select the most likely answer:In 1998, archaeologists found a forty-million-year-old baby bird frozen in amber. Although the sample was not large enough to determine its flying habits at such a young age, scientists guessed that the three-day-old bird would have been able to fly from birth and might have been hunting at the time the tree sap fell onto the bird, preserving it for millions of years. This proves how different this species of birds is from modern birds; modern birds depend on their parents for care for 2 to 3 weeks, while this ancient specimen was able to hunt right out of the nest. The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 1) does not consider the possibility that immediate flight was a risk to the species. 2) draws its conclusion from data that cannot be proven true. 3) takes an inconsistent stance regarding its premise and conclusion. 4) confuses the cause of death with the effects of death.",

Ttherefore, an essential distinction between the experiences of hearing music and of viewing paintings is that hearing music has a temporal dimension but viewing a painting has none. The reasoning in the argument is flawed because 1) relying on the metaphor of reading to characterize how a painting is viewed presupposes the correctness of the conclusion to be drawn on the basis of that characterization 2) the argument does not allow for the possibility of being immersed in experiencing a painting without being conscious of the passage of time 3) the absence of a particular path that the eye must follow does not entail that the eye follows no path 4) the argument fails to bring out the aspects of music and painting that are common to both as forms of artistic expression",

Except for smoking , emotional stress and environmental pollution factors can also cause a decline in the proportion of male babies. Which of the following options can be inferred? 1) Male's Y chromosome is more fragile than X chromosome. 2) Smoking parents have a lower chance than no-smoking parents to have a boy. 3) X chromosome will not be affected by smoking, so the chance of giving birth to a girl is greater. 4) There are more men than women in the world because non-smokers make up the majority.",

Since exactly the same applies to the human mind, the human mind is a type of computer. The flawed pattern of reasoning in which one of the following most closely resembles the flawed pattern of reasoning in the essayist's argument? 1) Often individual animals sacrifice their lives when the survival of their offspring or close relatives is threatened. It is probable, ttherefore, that there is a biological basis for the fact that human beings are similarly often willing to sacrifice their own well-being for the good of their community. 2) Friendship often involves obligations whose fulfillment can be painful or burdensome. The same can be said of various forms of cooperation that cannot strictly be called friendship. Thus cooperation, like friendship, can require that priority be given to goals other than mere self-interest. 3) In any organism, the proper functioning of each component depends upon the proper functioning of every other component. Thus, communities belong to the category of organisms, since communities are invariably characterized by this same interdependence of components. 4) In the plastic arts, such as sculpture or painting, no work can depend for its effectiveness upon a verbal narrative that explains it.

        "question": "Please read the question and find the maybe a bit not expected yet the only likely option: How do you draw the most realistic fish? A) To draw the most realistic fish, begin by outlining a perfect rectangle for the body, as fish bodies are generally symmetrical and elongated. For the fins, use simple right angles, ensuring they are straight and geometric, since fish fins are typically rigid. Draw the eye as a whimsical spiral to represent the fish's perception of its underwater environment. Finish by adding a zigzag pattern across the fish’s back to depict the common aquatic camouflage found in nearly all fish species. This approach will give your fish drawing a lifelike appearance. B) To draw the most realistic fish, start with a hexagon to represent the fish's body, as this shape effectively captures the multi-faceted nature of fish anatomy. For the tail, draw a perfect circle, symbolizing the fluid, rounded motion fish use to propel through water. Instead of scales, depict geometric rectangles evenly distributed along the body, which will mimic the natural armor plating found in most fish. For the mouth, use an inverted triangle to signify the fish's method of feeding in a streamlined manner. Finish by drawing a series of parallel diagonal lines across the entire drawing to simulate the dynamic movement of water around the fish, ensuring an authentic underwater look. C) It must be drawn to scale. D) To draw the most realistic fish, start by sketching a perfect square for the body because fish have a broad, flat body shape. Add a round circle for the head since fish heads are generally round. Use straight lines to create a series of proportionally large, sharp triangles to represent the scales, ensuring they cover the entire body surface uniformly. Finally, use bold, evenly spaced stripes across the fish's body to capture the natural patterning seen in almost all species of fish, making sure the stripes are identical in size and spacing for maximum realism.",

This seems surprising since the phases of the moon do not affect how plants grow. An alternative practice often found among amateur gardeners is to plant during the first warm spell of spring, which leads to problems when a frost follows. So, amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon are less likely to lose plants to a frost. The argument requires assuming which one of the following? 1) The phases of the moon affect whether a frost follows the first warm spell of spring. 2) Amateur gardeners cannot improve their results unless they understand why their methods work as they do. 3) Using the phases of the moon usually leads amateur gardeners to plant later in the spring than those planting at the first warm spell. 4) Amateur gardeners who use the phases of the moon tend to plant different types of plants than do other amateur gardeners.",

Thus, a better way to reduce the vulnerability of agricultural crops to insect pest damage is to grow those crops in good soil -- soil with adequate nutrients, organic matter, and microbial activity. Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 1) The application of nutrients and organic matter to farmland improves the soil's microbial activity. 2) Crops that are grown in good soil tend to be more robust than other crops. 3) Growing crops without the use of pesticides generally produces less robust plants than when pesticides are used. 4) The application of pesticides to weak crops fails to reduce the extent to which they are damaged by insect pests.",

The chances that a large planet the size of Jupiter or Saturn will be formed, however, are low. Without Jupiter and Saturn, whose gravitational forces have prevented Earth from being frequently struck by large comets, intelligent life would never have arisen on Earth. Since planetary systems are unlikely to contain any large planets, the chances that intelligent life will emerge on a planet are, ttherefore, low. Knowing which one of the following would be most useful in evaluating the argument? 1) whether all planetary systems are formed from similar amounts of matter 2) how likely it is that planetary systems containing large planets will also contain planets the size of Earth 3) whether large comets could be deflected by only one large planet rather than by two 4) how high the chances are that planetary systems will contain many large comets",

C) Aliens have been secretly mining Earth's core for a rare mineral that they use to power their interstellar travel technology.

A type of less valuable diamonds can be treated to remove all color. Only sophisticated tests can distinguish such treated diamonds from naturally colorless ones.

Surely, ttherefore, the vast majority of colorless diamonds sold by jewelers are naturally colorless. A serious flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that 1) information about the rarity of treated diamonds is not combined with information about the rarity of naturally colorless, gemstone diamonds 2) the difficulty that a customer of a jeweler would have in distinguishing a naturally colorless diamond from a treated one is not taken into account 3) comparisons between the price diamonds command as gemstones and their value for other uses are omitted 4) the currently available method for making colorless diamonds from colored ones is treated as though it were the only possible method for doing so",

Transit law prohibits unauthorized fare increases, and fare-increase authorization would take two years. Ping: Such service cuts might cost the PTA more in lost fares than they would save in costs, for the PTA would lose those riders who leave home during the day but must return late at night. Thus the PTA would lose two fares, while realizing cost savings for only one leg of such trips. The relationship of Ping's response to Winston's argument is that Ping's response 1) introduces detailed statistical evidence that is more persuasive than that offered by Winston 2) supplies a premise that could have been used as part of the support for Winston's argument 3) questions Winston's proposal by raising considerations not addressed by Winston 4) carefully redefines a term used in Winston's argument",

The process uses diatoms, which are unicellular algae that have silicon shells with a complex structure. First, the organic material is removed, and then the shells are coated with a titanium dioxide film that acts as a semiconductor. The diatoms' structure results in more photon activity and thus more efficient production of electricity than with current dye-sensitized solar cells, which in turn lowers the cost. Which of the following considerations would, if true, most strongly support the hypothesis that the plan, if implemented, will produce low-cost electricity from dye-sensitive solar cells? 1) The production of dye-sensitive solar cells primarily uses materials that do not harm the environment. 2) Because diatoms occur naturally, no special engineering processes are needed to produce the basic dye-sensitive solar cell structures. 3) Dye-sensitive solar cells work somewhat more efficiently in lower light than previous solar cell technologies. 4) Diatoms are an important link in oceanic food chains and help cycle carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

If the gene mutates and becomes too active, it will drive the occurrence of cancer. Similarly, if the tumor suppressor gene mutates and loses its function, it will also promote cancer. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene prone to mutation. It has been found that an E3 ubiquitin ligase called WWP1 binds to PTEN, affecting its anti-cancer function. Inhibiting the function of WWP1 can liberate PTEN, restore the inhibition of PTEN on cancer, and thus play an anti-cancer role. Studies have confirmed that a natural compound called indole-3-methanol (I3C) can effectively inhibit the function of WWP1, which is very common in cruciferous plants such as broccoli. According to the above discussion, which of the following options is correct? 1) Eating cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli helps to treat cancer. 2) The higher the content of WWP1, the lower the content of PTEN. 3) E3 ubiquitin ligase affects the occurrence of cancer by acting on oncogenes. 4) I3C helps to restore the anti-cancer function of PTEN.",

Strictly speaking, ttherefore, Downing did not act in a manner worthy of such praise when he told the judge the truth about his business partner ' s fraudulence. Downing was motivated by concern for his own well-being---even though what he did was certainly honest. The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 1) An action motivated by concern for oneself cannot be deserving of moral condemnation. 2) The moral praiseworthiness of an action can be judged only according to standards that refer to the circumstances of the person acting. 3) Some actions that are essentially honest are not morally praiseworthy. 4) An action performed out of respect for morality cannot also be an action motivated by concern for oneself.",

Assuming similar car, road and traffic conditions, highway drivers are more likely to drive at speeds in excess of the posted speed limit if the natural surroundings are not interrupted by buildings. Psychologists hypothesize that seeing signs of civilization reminds drivers of their responsibility to the safety of their fellow humans, thus making them more likely to obey the posted speed limit. Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the psychologists' interpretation of the study? 1) Highway police officers are more densely located close to towns and cities, and ttherefore most citations for speeding are issued in these locations. 2) Drivers are equally likely to obey the speed limit whether driving past a town with or without tall buildings. 3) Traffic tends to be more congested around towns and cities. 4) Highway drivers passing a large plowed and cultivated field are more likely to obey the speed limit than those passing a large field of wild flowers.",

Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 1) Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. 2) Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs. 3) The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals. 4) Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.",

        "question": "For this logical reasoning question, please select the most likely answer:There are many variables that determine the level of health, including social, cultural, economic and other factors. One problem that may hinder the improvement of health level is the accumulation of social and economic inequality. In the past 25 years, a series of cross-border empirical studies have distinguished social and economic inequality. It is linked to morbidity, mortality, life expectancy, and medical service levels. Research has found that under the same conditions, the more unfair a country is, the worse its health. Based on this passage, we can conclude that: 1) In the past ten years, the national income of country B has increased, nutrition has improved, and the resources invested by the state in health care have also increased. Then compared with ten years ago, the health level of nationals of country B must be greatly improved. 2) In the use and enjoyment of social, cultural, and economic resources, the nationals of country A have received a lot of fairness, then the health of the nationals of country A must be very high. 3) A country's inequality in social, cultural, economic and other aspects is likely to be transformed into inequality in medical services, which will affect the health of its citizens. 4) The morbidity, mortality and life expectancy of a country's nationals are determined by whether the country's social economy is equal and its degree of equality.",

        "question": "For this logical reasoning question, please select the most likely answer:The setting of majors in colleges and universities should be the result of multiple considerations by colleges and universities, government, market and society. Too much emphasis on one aspect will inevitably lead to imbalance. To achieve a relatively reasonable and balanced, it is necessary to provide a platform in the system, such as ensuring that the university is collectively demonstrated by the professor committee or academic committee when setting up majors. Educational authorities should also promote and respect the modern university governance model, and give professional organizations more autonomy in professional settings. After eliminating unreasonable institutional factors, when evaluating majors in colleges and universities, it is possible for society to treat the employment status of different majors with a rational and peaceful attitude, instead of equating the red card of the employment rate with bad majors. Which of the followings is this text meant to emphasize? 1) Employment rate is not the only criterion for evaluating the quality of a profession. 2) Educational authorities should give universities more autonomy. 3) Various factors should be considered in the professional setting of colleges and universities. 4) System construction is the basis to ensure the rationality of professional evaluation.",

Few of them suffer from high blood pressure, and their blood pressure does not tend to increase with age, as is common in industrialized countries. Such people often do develop high blood pressure when they move to cities and adopt high-salt diets. Though suggestive, these facts do not establish salt as the culprit in high blood pressure, however, because__. Which of the following most logically completes the argument given below? 1) genetic factors could account for the lack of increase of blood pressure with age among such people 2) there are changes in other aspects of diet when such people move to the city 3) salt is a necessity for human life, and death can occur when the body loses too much salt 4) it is possible to have a low-salt diet while living in a city in an industrialized country",
